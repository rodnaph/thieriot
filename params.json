It allows you to check which of your branches have Jenkins\r\njobs set up, easily create any that are missing, kick off jobs, etc...\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n![](http://github.com/rodnaph/thieriot/raw/master/images/default.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, each of your branches will be listed, along with...\r\n\r\n* a tick/cross indicating if it has a build on Jenkins\r\n* an ID you can refer to it as for commands\r\n* information about if it is currently building or not\r\n* if the branch has a build and it's failing the name will be red\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nConfiguration is handled via a YAML file in your project root called _.thieriot.yml_.  The only required\r\nparameter is the _jenkins_url_, if you don't specify the project name it will be guessed from the folder\r\nname of your project.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\njenkins_url: jenkins.mycompany.com\r\nproject_name: myproject\r\n```\r\n\r\nThieriot assumes your jobs are named after your project, with a hyphen then the branch name.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyproject-master\r\nmyproject-featurebranch\r\netc...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\n\r\nIf your Jenkins instance requires authentication you can configure this using your\r\nJenkins username and your API token.  Just create the following environment\r\nvariables (eg. in .bash_profile or .zshrc).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport THIERIOT_USER=myuser\r\nexport THIERIOT_TOKEN=jj324g23jh4gj32h4g3hj4g234j23\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Creating a Jenkins job\r\n\r\nThe way Thieriot works is to use your master branch's job to create copies for\r\nyour feature branches.  This obviously means you need to create your master\r\nbuild yourself, but after that setting up jobs for your feature branches is easy.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$> trt create 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will try and create a job for the branch numbered _2_.\r\n\r\n## Building and following jobs\r\n\r\nYour jobs will probably build automatically on some commit hooks, but if they don't\r\nthen you can kick them off from the shell.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$> trt follow 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will start a job if it's not already building, and then print the console\r\noutput to the shell.\r\n\r\n![](http://github.com/rodnaph/thieriot/raw/master/images/follow.png)\r\n\r\nIf you only want to build the job and not follow its output use *build*\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$> trt build 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cancelling, viewing and deleting jobs\r\n\r\nIf you need to stop a running job that's easy with the cancel command...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$> trt cancel 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to quickly open your browser to the branch's jobs page on\r\nJenkins, use the view command...  _NB:_ Only works on OSX at the moment.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$> trt view 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when you're done with feature branch jobs, it's easy to delete them right from the shell.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$> trt delete 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWatch you don't delete master though! :O (don't worry Thieriot won't let you) You can\r\ncancel a running job easily too...\r\n\r\n## Arbitrary job names\r\n\r\nAll Thieriot's commands can take a number as the alias for the branch/job.  But you can\r\nalso use arbitrary names, that may match jobs that you don't have branches for.  For\r\ninstance if your project has a packaging job named _myproject-pkg_ you could kick this\r\noff and follow its progress using...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$> trt follow pkg\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n## Macports\r\n\r\nYou can install Thieriot straight through MacPorts.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$> port install thieriot\r\n```\r\n\r\n## From Source\r\n\r\nTo install Thieriot from source just clone the repo, and put it in your _PATH_.\r\nYou might also need some of the dependencies, listed below depending on your OS.\r\n\r\n * Perl\r\n * Perl JSON\r\n * Perl JAML\r\n\r\nPerl modules available from CPAN if they're not packaged for your OS.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$> sudo cpan\r\ninstall JSON\r\ninstall YAML\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","name":"Thieriot"}
